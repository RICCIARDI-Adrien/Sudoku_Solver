Building the program
--------------------

There are two available configurations :
- Type "make" to compile the program in release mode, which is the faster
  solving mode and does not display debug informations.
- Type "make debug" to compile the program in debug mode. A lot of debug
  informations will be displayed and the program will be really slow.

Grid files format
-----------------

A grid file is a simple text file as following :
- Each cell number is represented by a single character.
- There is no space between characters.
- The length of the lines represents the grid's size.
- An empty cell is represented by the point character '.'.
- The accepted grid sizes are 6x6, 9x9, 12x12 and 16x16.
- The accepted numbers are '0' to 'F' (hexadecimal numbers).
- Example : here is a 6x6 grid :
    2.1523
    .3514.
    014.52
    3524.1
    .03.15
    5210.4
